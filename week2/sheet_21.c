// Worksheet 21: Building a Bag using a Dynamic Array

// In preparation: Read Chapter 8 to learn more about the Bag data type. 
// If you have not done so already, complete Worksheet 14 to learn about the basic features of the dynamic array.

// The stack, queue and deque data abstractions are all characterized by maintaining values in the order they were inserted. 
// In many situations, however, it is the values themselves, and not their time of insertion, that is of primary importance. 
// The simplest data structure that is simply concerned with the values, and not their time of insertion, is the Bag. 
// A conceptual definition of the Bag operations is shown at right. In subsequent lessons we will encounter several different 
// implementation techniques for this abstraction. In this lesson we will explore how to create a bag using a dynamic array as the underlying storage area.

// Recall that the dynamic array structure maintained three data fields. The first was a reference to an array of objects. 
// The number of positions in this array, held in an integer data field, was termed the capacity of the container. 
// The third value was an integer that represented the number of elements held in the container. This was termed the size of the collection. 
// The size must always be smaller than or equal to the capacity.
 
// As new elements are inserted, the size is increased. If the size reaches the capacity, then a new internal array 
// is created with twice the capacity, and the values are copied from the old array into the new. In Worksheet14 you 
// wrote a routine _setCapacityDynArr, to perform this operation. 

// To add an element to the dynamic array you can simply insert it at the end. This is exactly the same behavior as the
// function addDynArray you wrote in Worksheet 14.

// The contains function is also relatively simple. It simply uses a loop to cycle over the index values, examining each 
// element in turn. If it finds a value that matches the argument, it returns true. If it reaches the end of the collection 
// without finding any value, it returns false. Because we want the container to be generalized, we define equality using a 
// macro definition. This is similar to the symbolic constant trick we used to define the type TYPE. The macro is defined as follows:

# ifndef EQ
# define EQ(a, b) (a == b)
# endif

// The ifndef preprocessor instruction allows the user to provide an alternative definition for the EQ function. 
// If none is provided, the primitive equality operator will be used.

// The remove function is the most complicated of the Bag abstraction. To simplify this task we will divide it into 
// two distinct steps. The remove function, like the function contains, will loop over each position, examining the elements 
// in the collection. If it finds one that matches the desired value, it will invoke a separate function, removeAt (from Worksheet 14), 
// that removes the value held at a specific location. 

void removeDynArr (struct DynArr * da, TYPE test) {
   for (int i = 0; i < da->size; i++) {
      if (EQ(test, da->data[i])) { /* found it */
         _dynArrayRemoveAt(da, i);
         return;
      }
   }
}

// Notice two things about the remove function. First, if no matching element is found, the loop will terminate and the function 
// return without making any change to the data. Second, once an element has been found, the function returns. This means that
// if there were two or more occurrences of the value that matched the test element, only the first would be removed.

// The removeAt function takes as argument an index position in the array, and removes the element stored at that location. 
// This is complicated by the fact that when the element is removed, all values stored at locations with higher index values must be “moved down”.

 

// Once the values are moved down, the count must be decremented to indicate the size of the collection is decreased.

// Based on these ideas, complete the following skeleton implementation of the bag functions for the dynamic array. You can use 
// any of the functions you have previously written in earlier lessons.

 
struct DynArr {
        TYPE * data;
        int size;
        int capacity;
};

	/* the following were written in earlier lessons */
void initDynArr (struct DynArr * da, int initCap);
void addDynArr(struct DynArr * da, TYPE e);      

/* remove was shown earlier, to use removeAt */
void removeDynArr (struct DynArr * da, TYPE test) {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i < da->size; i++) {
      if (EQ(test, da->data[i])) { /* found it */
         _dynArrayRemoveAt(da, i);
         return;
      }
   }
}

/* you must write the following */

int containsDynArr (struct DynArr * da, TYPE e) {
	assert(!isEmptyDynArr(da));
	for(int i = 0; i < da->size; i++)
	{
		If(EQ(da->data[i], e))
		{
			return 1;
		}
	return 0;
	}
}

       
// 1.	What should the removeAt method do if the index given as argument is not in range? 
// If no matching element is found, an error message should be thrown to make the user aware that the value to be 
//removed is not in the array. The loop should terminate and the function should return without making any change to the data.

// 2.	What is the algorithmic complexity of the method removeAt? Given your answer to the previous question,
// what is the worst-case complexity of the method remove?
// The algorithmic complexity of the removeAt method is O(1), because the number of operations necessary is constant, 
// regardless of n. Because we need to traverse the array to copy the values, worst case is O(n).

// 3.	What are the algorithmic complexities of the operations add and contains?
// The add operation is O(1). Contains would be O(n) in the worst case scenario where each element has to be checked
// before the target value is located.
